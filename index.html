When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That’s because they were able to connect experiences they’ve had and synthesize new things. And the reason they were able to do that was that they’ve had more experiences or they have thought more about their experiences than other people.</p><div class="actions"><span class="delete ss-icon">delete</span><span class="edit ss-icon">write</span></div></li><li class=""><p>Unfortunately, that’s too rare a commodity. A lot of people in our industry haven’t had very diverse experiences. So they don’t have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem. The broader one’s understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have. </p><div class="actions"><span class="delete ss-icon">delete</span><span class="edit ss-icon">write</span></div></li><li class=""><p>I don’t think I’ve ever worked so hard on something, but working on Macintosh was the neatest experience of my life. Almost everyone who worked on it will say that. None of us wanted to release it at the end. It was as though we knew that once it was out of our hands, it wouldn’t be ours anymore. When we finally presented it at the shareholders’ meeting, everyone in the auditorium gave it a five-minute ovation. What was incredible to me was that I could see the Mac team in the first few rows. It was as though none of us could believe we’d actually finished it. Everyone started crying.</p><div class="actions"><span class="delete ss-icon">delete</span><span class="edit ss-icon">write</span></div></li><li class=""><p>Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.</p><div class="actions"><span class="delete ss-icon">delete</span><span class="edit ss-icon">write</span></div></li><li class=""><p>Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe</p><div class="actions"><span class="delete ss-icon">delete</span><span class="edit ss-icon">write</span></div></li><li class=""><p>Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.</p><div class="actions"><span class="delete ss-icon">delete</span><span class="edit ss-icon">write</span></div></li><li><p>Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.</p><div class="actions"><span class="delete ss-icon">delete</span><span class="edit ss-icon">write</span></div></li></ul>
